# Arduino

This repository contains the source code uploaded to the Arduino, that plays the Piano.

Communication with the Arduino is done via the [UI](https://github.com/Piano-Playing-Bot/ui/). The source code currently expects the [common](https://github.com/Piano-Playing-Bot/common) repository to be situated at `../common/` relative to this directory.

To build, you require the Arduino IDE. From there you can compile and upload the `main.ino` file to the Arduino.
